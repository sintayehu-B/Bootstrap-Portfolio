                                for me is a man who was told was over-rated and instead of being what was put to his
                                name, came up with the idea of actually doing the things that people expected him to be.
                                You want him to score 50 points, done. Want him to have a triple-double done and done.
                                So yes! I'm a James harden fan, maybe his actions might not be the best but the work he
                                puts in is what makes me his fan. </p>

                                three pointer in one game. Now yo umight say he is selfish but his had more than half of
